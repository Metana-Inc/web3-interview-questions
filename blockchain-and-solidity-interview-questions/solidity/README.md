# Blockchain and Solidity Interview Questions

### Solidity

1. **What is Solidity, and why is it important for Ethereum development?**

   - Hint: Discuss Solidity as a programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

2. **What are smart contracts? How do they work?**

   - Hint: Explain self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

3. **Can you describe the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?**

   - Hint: Discuss EVM as a decentralized computer that executes smart contracts.

4. **What are gas fees in Ethereum? How are they calculated?**

   - Hint: Explain the concept of gas, its role in transactions, and how fees are determined.

5. **How do you handle exceptions in Solidity?**

   - Hint: Discuss try-catch mechanisms and error handling patterns in Solidity.

6. **What are some common security vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts?**

   - Hint: Mention reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and insecure randomness.

7. **What is the difference between `call`, `delegatecall`, and `send` in Solidity?**

   - Hint: Explain each function's purpose and differences in context and security implications.

8. **How do you deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network?**

   - Hint: Discuss using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat for deployment.

9. **What is a Solidity library? How is it used?**

   - Hint: Describe reusable code that can be deployed once and used by other contracts.

10. **What is the purpose of the `require` statement in Solidity?**

    - Hint: Explain its use for validation and ensuring conditions are met.

11. **Can you explain the concept of ERC-20 tokens?**

    - Hint: Describe the standard for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum.

12. **What is the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens?**

    - Hint: Compare fungible (ERC-20) vs. non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens.

13. **What is a blockchain oracle, and why is it important?**

    - Hint: Discuss how oracles provide external data to smart contracts.

14. **How do you ensure the immutability of smart contracts?**

    - Hint: Explain deployment principles and the challenges of upgrading contracts.

15. **What is the role of consensus mechanisms in blockchain?**

    - Hint: Discuss mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

16. **How do you interact with a smart contract from a web application?**

    - Hint: Mention using Web3.js or Ethers.js for interaction.
