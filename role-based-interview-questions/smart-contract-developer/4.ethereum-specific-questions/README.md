# Smart Contract Developer Interview Questions

## Ethereum-Specific Questions

1. **What is Ethereum, and how does it differ from Bitcoin?**

   - Hint: Compare their purposes, functionalities, and underlying technologies.

2. **What is Ether, and what is it used for?**

   - Hint: Explain Ether as the cryptocurrency used to pay for computation on the Ethereum network.

3. **Can you list some Ethereum development and testing environments?**

   - Hint: Mention Remix, Truffle, Ganache, and Ethereum test networks like Rinkeby.

4. **What is the block size of Ethereum?**

   - Hint: State the current block size and its implications on transaction throughput.

5. **What is the current block reward in Ethereum?**

   - Hint: Mention the amount of Ether awarded to miners for successfully mining a block.

6. **How long is the block time in Ethereum?**

   - Hint: State the average time taken to mine a new block on the Ethereum network.

7. **What is the smallest unit of Ether?**

   - Hint: Discuss units like Wei, Gwei, and their relation to Ether.

8. **Arrange these denominations in the correct order: Gwei, Mwei, Kwei, Ether, Wei, microether, milliether.**

   - Hint: Provide the correct order from smallest to largest denomination.

9. **Who is the founder of Ethereum, and when was it launched?**

   - Hint: Name Vitalik Buterin and state the year of Ethereum’s launch.

10. **What are smart contracts, and how are they different from traditional contracts?**

    - Hint: Contrast their automation, self-execution, and trustless nature with traditional legal agreements.

11. **What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?**

    - Hint: Explain its role in executing smart contracts uniformly across all Ethereum nodes.

12. **What is Enterprise Ethereum?**

    - Hint: Discuss private or consortium-based Ethereum networks for enterprise use.

13. **What is a node in Ethereum, and how do you connect with one?**

    - Hint: Define nodes as network participants maintaining a copy of the blockchain, and methods to connect such as using JSON-RPC APIs.

14. **Which consensus mechanism does Ethereum use?**

    - Hint: Mention Proof of Work (PoW) currently and its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0.

15. **What programming languages are used for writing smart contracts in Ethereum?**

    - Hint: Mention Solidity as the primary language and others like Vyper.

16. **What are some common smart contract standards?**

    - Hint: List ERC standards like ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens).

17. **What is integer underflow/overflow?**

    - Hint: Define when an arithmetic operation results in a number outside the expected range, causing unexpected behavior in smart contracts.

18. **What is frontrunning, and how can it be prevented?**

    - Hint: Explain when someone exploits transactions by intercepting and prioritizing them based on knowledge of pending transactions, and prevention techniques.

19. **What is the account nonce in Ethereum, and why is it important?**

    - Hint: Define nonce as a sequential number assigned to transactions to prevent replay attacks and ensure transaction order.

20. **How can you obtain Ether?**

    - Hint: Discuss methods like purchasing on exchanges, mining, or receiving it as payment.

21. **What are the two types of Ethereum networks?**

    - Hint: Mention Mainnet and Testnets (Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.) used for development and testing.

22. **Why are gas fees necessary?**

    - Hint: Explain fees for computation and storage on the Ethereum network to incentivize miners and prioritize transactions.

23. **How much gas does a simple Ethereum transaction require?**

    - Hint: Provide an estimate based on current gas prices and typical transaction complexity.

24. **How many transactions can fit into an Ethereum block?**
    - Hint: Discuss block size limits and transaction sizes affecting block capacity.
