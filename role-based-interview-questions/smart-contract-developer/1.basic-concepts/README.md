# Smart Contract Developer Interview Questions

## Basic Concepts

1. **What is a smart contract, and how does it function?**

   - Hint: Discuss self-executing contracts on blockchain and their automation capabilities.

2. **Can you describe the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its role?**

   - Hint: Explain its function in executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

3. **What are some common use cases for smart contracts?**

   - Hint: Mention applications in finance, supply chain, gaming, etc., where trustless automation is beneficial.

4. **What is the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens?**

   - Hint: Highlight fungibility vs. non-fungibility and their respective applications.

5. **How do you deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network?**

   - Hint: Discuss steps like writing, compiling with Solidity, and deploying using tools like Remix or Truffle.

6. **What are some best practices for writing secure smart contracts?**

   - Hint: Include practices like input validation, avoiding reentrancy vulnerabilities, and thorough testing.

7. **What tools and environments do you use for smart contract development?**

   - Hint: Mention IDEs like Remix, development frameworks like Truffle, and test networks like Rinkeby.

8. **Explain the concept of gas and how to optimize it.**

   - Hint: Discuss gas as a transaction fee in Ethereum and optimizing contracts to reduce costs.

9. **What is the purpose of the `fallback` function in Solidity?**

   - Hint: Explain its role in handling Ether transactions that don’t match any other function signatures.

10. **How do you handle updates and migrations for smart contracts?**
    - Hint: Discuss upgradeable contracts using patterns like proxy contracts or state migration.
